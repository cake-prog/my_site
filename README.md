My first site. Type: social network. Markup is implemented using the programming language HTML and page styles are imposed using the language CSS. Also, using the language PHP, communication with the local server is implemented phpmyadmin: data transfer to the server and sending data are configured. The site cannot be called full-fledged since much in it still needs to be implemented.
